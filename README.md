Power BI Project: Financial &amp; Risk Analysis for Construction Supply Chain
Construction Procurement Dashboard: Value & Risk Analysis
Objective: To transform raw ERP procurement data into a dynamic business intelligence tool in Power BI, shifting the focus from simply tracking costs to actively managing value, efficiency, and supply chain risk for multi-million dollar construction projects.

Key Technical Skills Demonstrated:

Data Modeling: Successfully cleaned, linked, and integrated four separate data sources (PO\_Data, Supplier\_Master, Material\_Master, Contracts\_RFQ) using robust One-to-Many relationships.

DAX & Analysis: Developed and implemented three critical, custom procurement KPIs: TotalSpend, OTDPercent (On-Time Delivery Rate), and TotalPPV (Purchase Price Variance) to measure financial performance against contractual standards.

Data Integrity: Solved complex external data integration challenges (Excel VLOOKUP errors) and internal Power BI naming conflicts to ensure a single, reliable source of truth for all metrics.

Actionable Insights & Value Delivered:

Cost Control (PPV): The Financial Analysis page provides granular tracking of costs, revealing a net [Insert your TotalPPV number here] in cost [Savings / Overruns] compared to the Standard Contract Price. The analysis highlights that the [Material Group with the highest spend] category requires immediate attention due to its financial impact.

Supplier Risk & Efficiency: The Vendor Scorecard on the Reliability page ranks all suppliers by performance. It identified [Name the Supplier with the lowest OTD%] as the highest schedule risk, with a low XX% OTD rate and an average YY days lead time. This requires immediate mitigation or vendor replacement.

Strategic Insight: The geographic spend distribution shows a concentration of XX% of the total budget tied to the [Region with the most spend] region. This indicates a key dependency risk, suggesting a need to diversify the supplier base to enhance resilience.
