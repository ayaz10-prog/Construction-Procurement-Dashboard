Power BI Project: Financial &amp; Risk Analysis for Construction Supply Chain
Construction Procurement Dashboard: Value & Risk Analysis
Objective: To transform raw ERP procurement data into a dynamic business intelligence tool in Power BI, shifting the focus from simply tracking costs to actively managing value, efficiency, and supply chain risk for multi-million dollar construction projects.

Key Technical Skills Demonstrated:
Data Modeling: Successfully cleaned, linked, and integrated four separate data sources (PO\_Data, Supplier\_Master, Material\_Master, Contracts\_RFQ) using robust One-to-Many relationships.
DAX & Analysis: Developed and implemented three critical, custom procurement KPIs: TotalSpend, OTDPercent (On-Time Delivery Rate), and TotalPPV (Purchase Price Variance) to measure financial performance against contractual standards.
Actionable Insights & Value Delivered (Scenario Examples)
Replace the bold, bracketed text with your actual numbers:

1. Cost Control (PPV)
The Financial Analysis page provides granular tracking of costs, revealing a net [$-\$45,000$] in cost [Overruns] compared to the Standard Contract Price. This negative Total PPV is primarily driven by the [Structural Steel] category, which highlights a breakdown in contract adherence and requires immediate corrective action.

3. Supplier Risk & Efficiency
The Vendor Scorecard on the Reliability page ranks all suppliers by performance. It identified [Gulf Rebar Steel Co.] as the highest schedule risk, with a low [65%] OTD rate and an average [45 days] lead time. This significant variance from the project standard requires immediate mitigation or vendor replacement.

4. Strategic Insight
The geographic spend distribution shows a concentration of [65%] of the total budget tied to the [Middle East (UAE/KSA)] region. This indicates a high dependency risk, suggesting a need to diversify the supplier base toward regions like [Europe] to enhance supply chain resilience.

Data Integrity: Solved complex external data integration challenges and internal Power BI naming conflicts (e.g., using SUMX for TotalSpend) to ensure a single, reliable source of truth.
